# switch-2-lambdas

This is an example showing how switch statements can be replaced with lambda expressions.

## Usage

The code is meant as an example hence it has no use of its own.
However the code can be used as guide to implement your own solution without switch/case blocks.

The [provided unit test](https://github.com/legolas/switch-2-lambdas/blob/master/src/test/java/nl/dullsoft/demo/lambda/SwitchVersusLambdaTest.java) demonstrates that both implementations behave the same.
